Initial release of [vim-mediawiki](https://github.com/m-pilia/vim-mediawiki), a
plugin to edit MediaWiki pages in vim/Neovim.
{% endevent %}

{% event academia, October 2019 %}
Published the paper *[Average volume reference space for large scale
registration of whole-body magnetic resonance
images](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222700)*.

An overview of the research work is summarized in [a blog
post](/posts/2019/11/17/jacobian-registration.html).
{% endevent %}

{% event project, May 2019 %}
Initial release of [vim-yggdrasil](https://github.com/m-pilia/vim-yggdrasil), a
library plugin to create tree views in vim/Neovim.

Initially developed as a reusable component for my
[vim-ccls](https://github.com/m-pilia/vim-ccls) project, has later been adopted
by the popular [vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) project
[[1]](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp/blob/24d9f18bca370d7539079dcbea1fe13d0ae1dc8f/autoload/lsp/utils/tree.vim)
and has been source of inspiration for similar plugins (like
[ccls.nvim](https://github.com/ranjithshegde/ccls.nvim), that implemented a Lua
port of vim-yggdrasil).
{% endevent %}

{% event project, May 2019 %}

then state-of-the-art deformable image registration library and toolkit.
{% endevent %}

{% event project, September 2018 %}
I implemented a [groupwise landmark-based
metric](https://github.com/m-pilia/CorrespondingPointsMeanDistanceMetric) for
the Elastix image registration toolkit, together with an [accompanying blog

minimal GPU-accelerated raycaster with an [accompanying blog post
tutorial](https://martinopilia.com/posts/2018/09/17/volume-raycasting.html).

Initially developed as a research tool, it has later been used and cited by
unrelated researchers [[1]](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02580) and part of
the code has been incorporated in the official Qt6 SDK examples
[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240721210046/https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick3d-attribution-alpha-blending-frag.html).
