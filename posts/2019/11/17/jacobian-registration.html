        <p>In Uppsala I spent several months investigating the generation of displacement
fields with known volume changes, and I even implemented <a href="https://github.com/m-pilia/disptools">a software
suite</a> for the purpose. This might seem
an odd topic to pick as working subject, so it is worth a bit of clarification
about its purpose and applications.</p>

<p>My voyage in the realm of displacements with known volume changes stems from
the work on image registration I did at Akademiska sjukhuset, the Uppsala
University Hospital, around the time I was working on my master’s thesis in
computer science. I think this is an interesting topic of research, and this
post aims to explain what it is and how it relates with displacement fields and
Jacobian determinants.</p>

<h1 id="imiomics-in-a-nutshell">Imiomics in a nutshell</h1>

<p><em>Imaging-omics</em>, or <em>imiomics</em> for short, is a medical image analysis
methodology introduced at Uppsala University in 2017, that allows to study and
visualise pointwise correlations between the local body composition and
non-image biomarkers <a class="citation" href="#strand2017concept">[1]</a>. In this context, “body
composition” denotes local information such as the volume and composition of
tissues in each point of the body, while non-image biomarkers can be for
instance body measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, etc.), blood
analysis values, physical test (bioimpedance, VO<sub>2</sub> max, etc.), and
any other numeric measures that can be associated to a subject.</p>

<p>In other words, imiomics makes it possible to visualise a correlation map
between some local physical property of the body and other global measures. The
following example from Lind et al. <a class="citation" href="#lind2019proof">[2]</a> gives a clear idea
of the power of such approach, showing the correlation between adipose tissue
volume and total fat mass, lean mass, and waist-hip ratio. Clear correlations
are visible, such as a positive one between subcutaneous tissues in the hips
and total fat mass, and a negative one between lung volume and total fat mass:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43690-w">

</a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Illustration from Lind et al. <a class="citation" href="#lind2019proof">[2]</a>
</div>

<p>While probably such results do not come as a surprise, they prove the concept
to be working and demonstrate the potential of such technique, that can be used
to discover and study less obvious correlations and produce novel results.
Another example from the same paper shows the correlation between the local fat
content and the same scalars as in the previous example. This time it shows a
different and probably less intuitive picture, with high fat mass strongly
correlated with the fat content in a much thinner layer of subcutaneous fat:</p>

</a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<p>In addition to the group studies in the example above, imiomics is suitable for
other types of statistical analysis, such as longitudinal studies, where the
evolution of a single subject is followed up through time, or anomaly
detection, where discrepancies between a subject and a normality atlas (e.g.
the presence of lesions) are identified <a class="citation" href="#sjoholm2019whole">[3]</a>.</p>

<h1 id="technicalities-under-the-hood">Technicalities under the hood</h1>

<p>The local fat and water content can be easily measured with a non-invasive and
radiation-free approach, by using fat-water separated magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), making it ideal for investigation studies. The addition of
positron emission tomography (PET) data, that gives a functional insight of the
metabolic processes, allows broader applications to fields such as oncology.
These are well known imaging techniques that have been around for decades, but
the innovative part of imiomics is how they are exploited to make it possible
to preform group studies at voxel resolution.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/img/imio/diagram0.png" class="pull-right content-image-padded" style="width:30%;" /></p>

<p>Given a cohort composed by \(n\) subjects \(I_1, \dots, I_n\), the key idea is
to construct an atlas \(I_R\) representative of the group, and to register all
subjects to it. Whole body registration is a difficult task, due to high
intra-subject anatomical and pose variability. A deformable registration method
based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_cut_optimization">graph cut
optimisation</a> allows to
get a pointwise transform with sub-voxel accuracy, robustly handling difficult
cases and with fast computational time <a class="citation" href="#ekstrom2020fast">[4]</a>. If PET data
is collected together with the MR data by using a combined scanner, therefore
producing inherently co-registered PET and MR images, the transform obtained by
registering the MR can be used to also warp the PET data, allowing to produce a
PET atlas.</p>

<p>After all subjects are registered to the common reference space, each voxel of
the atlas is mapped to a point in each subject \(I_k\) by a transform \(f_k\),
forming a vector of samples that can be used for statistical analysis.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Moreover, the spatial Jacobian determinant \(J[f]\) of a transform \(f\)
mapping the atlas to subject \(I_n\)</p>

\[J[f](\boldsymbol{x}) =
    \left| \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(\boldsymbol{x}) \right|_{ij}\]

<p>gives the local volume change induced by \(f\) at point \(\boldsymbol{x}\),
that represents the local tissue volume of subject \(I_n\) at point
\(\boldsymbol{x}\) with respect to the reference space. A Jacobian determinant
equal to one denotes no volume change, a value greater than one denotes local
expansion, a value between zero and one denotes local compression. Values
lesser or equal than zero denote a physically unfeasible transform, and
typically emerge from errors or imperfections in the image registration
process.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>While the transform \(f\) maps points from reference space coordinates to
source image coordinates, in the context of image registration it is often
convenient to express the deformation as a displacement \(d\), i.e. the
difference between the transform \(f\) and the identity, that tells how much a
point needs to be displaced from its reference space coordinates in order to
reach its position in source image coordinates.</p>

\[f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \boldsymbol{x} + d(\boldsymbol{x})\]

<p>From this it naturally follows that the Jacobian determinant of a transform
equals the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of its associated displacement
summed with the identity matrix</p>

\[J[f](\boldsymbol{x}) =
    \left| \delta_{ij} + \frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_j}(\boldsymbol{x}) \right|_{ij}\]

<p>where \(\delta_{ij}\) is Kronecker’s delta function. This is a small and simple
detail, but it can nevertheless be a source of confusion. In the following, the
Jacobian determinant is always the Jacobian of the transform, not the one of
the displacement, since the latter does not express the local volume change
induced by the transform.</p>

<h1 id="reference-space">Reference space</h1>

<p>Given a good dataset and a robust registration method, the only remaining issue
is how to determine the atlas to be used in the registration process. The
problem of determining an optimal and unbiased atlas for the registration of a
population has been an intense topic of study, especially in the field of
neuroimaging, leading to the development of what is known as groupwise image
registration. While classical image registration solves the problem of finding
a common coordinate system for a pair of images, and it can be applied
iteratively, one pair of images at time, to register a population to a common
frame, groupwise registration aims to register an entire group of images to a
frame that is optimal for the population as a whole.</p>

<p>Several groupwise registration methodologies have been developed since the
early 2000s, including pairwise registration to an explicit template that is
iteratively warped according to some average property of the individual
transforms <a class="citation" href="#guimond2000average">[5], [6]</a> and implicit methods
that construct the set of transforms for all images simultaneously, optimising
some groupwise metric defined over all images and transforms <a class="citation" href="#balci2006free">[7], [8]</a>. Interestingly, the latter approach does not
require any choice of template image a priori, and it does not produce any
explicit reference image but only a set of transforms. If desired, a reference
image can be recovered by averaging the warped subjects.</p>

<p>While groupwise methods, especially implicit methods, nicely address the
problem of the bias toward an arbitrary reference space in the registration of
a populations, often with elegant theoretical frameworks, in practice they
still present some inconveniences. Groupwise approaches can have difficulties
to handle large deformations and finely align structures, and this represents
an issue, since imiomics requires a fairly accurate registration. Moreover, the
computational cost and memory footprint of implicit methods increase with the
size of the group being registered: if the groupwise transform has the form of
\(T(\boldsymbol{\mu})\), where \(\boldsymbol{\mu}\) is the vector of all
parameters from all transforms, and the groupwise metric is defined over the
\(n+1\)-dimensional volume obtained by stacking the input images \(I_1, \dots,
I_n\), the cost of optimisation is going to grow (super-linearly, in most
cases) as a function of the population size. This makes it difficult to scale
to large populations, especially when considering the size of whole body
images, typically larger than the brain images used in the development of most
groupwise methods.</p>

<h1 id="optimising-the-reference-space">Optimising the reference space</h1>

<p>Given the practical limitations of implicit groupwise methods, registration of
the population can be done in a pairwise fashion against an explicit reference
image. A good reference can be a subject from the cohort with “average”
properties, such as size and weight, that is representative of the normal
anatomy of the cohort, and possibly having good quality of image acquisition
(such as the absence of imaging artefacts). Moreover, given the importance of
tissue volume in many imiomics applications, a desired property of the
reference space is what we can call “neutrality with respect to volume
changes”: when mapping the reference to all subjects, the average volume change
in each point of the reference space should be null. Since we measure volume
change through the Jacobian determinant of the transforms, and a unit Jacobian
implies conservation of local volume, the geometric mean of the Jacobian maps
for all subjects should be one in all points of the reference space.</p>

\[\prod_i J[f_i](\boldsymbol{x}) = 1\]

<p>While it is usually possible to reasonably fulfill the first property of good
representativity of the cohort, by carefully selecting a reference, the last
requirement on neutrality with respect to volume changes is unlikely to happen
by chance. Since the subcutaneous fat deposits contribute to a significant
portion of the body volume variability for subjects of comparable height, a
possible heuristic is to select as the reference a subject that both height and
total fat mass<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> simultaneously close to the respective medians for the
population. This helps to get a good guess of the average volume for the
cohort, but it is obviously far from having the desired mean volume everywhere
in a pointwise fashion <a class="citation" href="#pilia2019average">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>In principle, this issue could be overcome in different ways. One possibility
would be to perform an implicit-reference groupwise registration, adding a
regularisation term to penalise a mean Jacobian far from one. While this
appears to be an elegant solution, there are practical concerns that make it
hard to apply. One is the computational cost of groupwise registration, both in
terms of memory footprint and time complexity, that grows (often superlinearly)
with the size of the cohort of subjects, making it unfeasible to register large
populations. Another concern is the intrinsic difficulty of whole body
registration, that requires robust deformable registration methods in order to
obtain transforms sufficiently accurate for imiomics analysis.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/img/imio/iterative.svg" class="pull-right content-image-padded" style="width:25%;" /></p>

<p>An alternative approach, used in some early groupwise registration methods <a class="citation" href="#guimond2000average">[5], [6]</a>, is to start with a subject from the
cohort as initial template, and iteratively refine it and repeat the
registration to the refined template, until the set of transforms from the
template towards the rest of the cohort satisfy a desired property. Thinking of
the images as points in some feature space, the intuitive idea is to have the
initial subject (red circle) iteratively moving in the feature space (red
squares) and converging to the mean of the population (black circles), for some
definition of mean that suits the problem.</p>

<p>Since the images can be registered one pair at a time, this approach has a
constant memory footprint and a time complexity that is linear in the size of
the cohort. Moreover, it is possible to apply any robust pairwise registration
algorithm, without having to face potential convergence struggles of implicit
groupwise methods in difficult scenarios.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/img/imio/diagram1.png" class="pull-right content-image-padded" style="width:52%;" /></p>

<p>At each iteration, a registration of the images \(I_1, \dots, I_n\) in the
group to the current template \(I_R\) is performed, producing a set of
transforms \(f_1, \dots, f_n\) with a certain mean Jacobian \(J\), and the
iterative correction \(d\) should somehow produce a new template \(I_{R'}\)
such that the mean Jacobian of \(f_1 \circ d^{-1}, \dots, f_n \circ d^{-1}\) is
closer to one in every point. A reasonable approach is to pick a deformation
\(d\) such that its Jacobian is exactly \(J\), therefore cancelling the
residual mean volume. Ideally, this could be done in a single iteration and, if
everything was perfect, a new registration of all subjects to the new reference
\(I_{R'}\) should produce as deformations exactly \(f_1 \circ d^{-1}, \dots,
f_n \circ d^{-1}\). Alas, this is not likely to happen, due to the imperfection
of the registration methods and to limitations in accuracy of numerical
operations. However, it is possible to iterate rounds of registration to the
new reference and generation of a new template, until convergence.</p>

<p>The only remaining issue is how to produce a deformation with given Jacobian
determinant. Unfortunately, without further constraints, this is an ill-posed
problem, since infinite transforms can share the same Jacobian determinant.</p>

<h1 id="generation-of-dense-deformations-with-known-volume-changes">Generation of dense deformations with known volume changes</h1>

<p>One possibility is to model the problem as a mechanical deformation. In
principle, different assumptions can be made, leading to different deformation
models, and the resulting system of partial differential equations can be
solved numerically, for instance with finite differences <a class="citation" href="#khanal2017simulating">[10]</a> or finite elements <a class="citation" href="#smith2003biomechanical">[11], [12]</a>.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> This approach has some advantages, such as a
well understood mathematical and physical model, and the possibility to control
the physical properties of the tissues being deformed by manipulating the
parameters of such model. On the downside, however, the numerical solution of
this problem on the scale of a whole body image can be expensive in terms of
memory and computing time. Moreover, finite elements require a meaningful mesh
generation, that constitutes a whole problem on its own.</p>

<p>Another approach is constituted by search based methods. It is possible to
perform a search in the space of displacements by optimising a cost function
that accounts for the distance between the Jacobian determinant
\(J_\boldsymbol{d}\) of the deformation associated to displacement
\(\boldsymbol{d}\) and the desired Jacobian \(J^*\) <a class="citation" href="#karaccali2006simulation">[13], [14]</a>. While this approach may look tricky
in principle, due to the fact that infinite solutions exist, by using a null
displacement as initial guess it is likely to end the search in a reasonably
good solution.</p>

<p>A simple yet effective example of cost function for this problem is the squared
difference</p>

\[E(\boldsymbol{d}) =
    \frac{1}{2} \int
    \left( J_\boldsymbol{d}(\boldsymbol{x}) - J^*(\boldsymbol{x}) \right)^2
    \operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{x} .\]

<p>Such function is differentiable with respect to the components of the
displacement, therefore it is possible to perform gradient descent to minimise
it. It is also possible to add a regularisation term to penalise non-smooth and
physically unfeasible deformations, if necessary <a class="citation" href="#karaccali2006simulation">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>Given a displacement \(d(x,y,z) = \left(f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z) \right)\),
the partial derivatives in the expression of the Jacobian can be discretised
with central differences of step length \((\delta_x, \delta_y, \delta_z)\),
allowing to write the gradient of \(E\) in closed form. The partial derivative
of \(E\) with respect to the component \(f\) of the discrete displacement
at coordinates \((x, y, z)\) is given by</p>

\[\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial E(d)}{\partial f^{x,y,z}} =
        &amp;\sum_{\boldsymbol{x}}
            \left(
                J_{\boldsymbol{d}}(\boldsymbol{x}) - J^*(\boldsymbol{x})
            \right)
            \frac{\partial J_{\boldsymbol{d}} (\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial f^{x,y,z}}
        \\
        \approx&amp;\frac{e^{x-1,y,z}}{\delta_x}
        \begin{vmatrix}
            g_y^{x-1,y,z}  &amp;  f_z^{x-1,y,z} \\
            h_y^{x-1,y,z}  &amp;  h_z^{x-1,y,z} \\
        \end{vmatrix}
        -
        \frac{e^{x+1,y,z}}{\delta_x}
        \begin{vmatrix}
            g_y^{x+1,y,z}  &amp;  f_z^{x+1,y,z} \\
            h_y^{x+1,y,z}  &amp;  h_z^{x+1,y,z} \\
        \end{vmatrix}
        - \\
        &amp;\frac{e^{x,y-1,z}}{\delta_y}
        \begin{vmatrix}
            g_y^{x,y-1,z}  &amp;  f_z^{x,y-1,z} \\
            h_y^{x,y-1,z}  &amp;  h_z^{x,y-1,z} \\
        \end{vmatrix}
        +
        \frac{e^{x,y+1,z}}{\delta_y}
        \begin{vmatrix}
            g_y^{x,y+1,z}  &amp;  f_z^{x,y+1,z} \\
            h_y^{x,y+1,z}  &amp;  h_z^{x,y+1,z} \\
        \end{vmatrix}
        + \\
        &amp;\frac{e^{x,y,z-1}}{\delta_z}
        \begin{vmatrix}
            g_y^{x,y,z-1}  &amp;  f_z^{x,y,z-1} \\
            h_y^{x,y,z-1}  &amp;  h_z^{x,y,z-1} \\
        \end{vmatrix}
        -

            h_y^{x,y,z+1}  &amp;  h_z^{x,y,z+1} \\
        \end{vmatrix}
\end{align*}\]

<p>denoting with \(e^{x,y,z} = J_{\boldsymbol{d}}(x,y,z) - J^*(x,y,z)\) the local
distance to the target Jacobian, and with \(f_x^{x,y,z}\) the central difference
\(\frac{1}{\delta_x} \left(f(x+1,y,z) - f(x-1,y,z) \right)\).</p>

<p>This expression is a bit cumbersome, and it is possible to greatly cut the
calculations by throwing away all cross terms and approximate the gradient as
<a class="citation" href="#van2013mapping">[14]</a></p>

\[\nabla E \propto \left(
    e_{i-1,j,k} - e_{i+1,j,k},
    e_{i,j-1,k} - e_{i,j+1,k},
    e_{i,j,k-1} - e_{i,j,k+1}
\right) .\]

<p>It is possible to experimentally observe how removing the cross terms worsens
the improvement at each iteration and weakens the robustness of the search, but
the savings in terms of computing time are so big that in many cases it is
possible to compensate by performing more iterations and still reach a better
solution within the same computing time <a class="citation" href="#pilia2018groupwise">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the full gradient or its approximation is used, it is
possible to parallelise calculations for all voxels independently, making this
algorithm suitable for OpenMP and GPU computing.</p>

<p>An important trick to keep in mind is to mask a region of interest in the
image, and to relax the search outside it by reducing the cost of a mismatching
Jacobian in the background. This allows to redistribute the residual volume
change outside the body, greatly helping convergence. Otherwise, the
deformation would propagate to the boundary of the image volume, and if the
total volume change over the image does not integrate to zero the method would
not converge to a solution at all.</p>

<h1 id="some-results">Some results</h1>

<p><a href="/posts/img/imio/jacobian.png">
    <img src="/posts/img/imio/jacobian.png" class="pull-right content-image-padded" style="width:50%;" />
</a></p>

<p>Going back to the whole body group registration problem, now we have all the
tools to generate a synthetic whole body atlas with zero average volume change.
Given a cohort of 167 subjects, a subject with height and fat mass close to the
median is used as initial reference space (top-left panel), and the average
Jacobian (bottom-left panel) of the transforms that map it to the cohort is far
from being constant unitary. From this Jacobian, a displacement is generated
and its inverse is used to sample a new reference space (top-centre panel). The
difference image (top-right panel) shows how the anatomy is overall preserved
and tissue volumes are locally adjusted. When mapping the cohort to this new
reference space, this time the Jacobian (bottom-centre panel) is close to one
almost everywhere <a class="citation" href="#pilia2019average">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>It is fascinating to observe how this simple approach for the generation of a
displacement with given Jacobian can be applied on a relatively complicated
target. The Jacobian in this example shows a significant range of values, often
with sharp transitions (made harder by the low resolution of the image) and
sometimes with bad values, being close to zero in different regions (due to
local imperfections in the registration process, that cause unreasonably high
compression of the tissues in parts of the body). By comparison, previous
applications of this technique in neuroimaging made use of piecewise constant
target Jacobians, with only values of small magnitude.</p>
